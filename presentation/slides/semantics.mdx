# Semantics
Expressing our UI in a robust way to work with a variety of assistive technologies

---
# [Assistive Technologies](https://webaim.org/articles/motor/assistive)

Software, Devices and Tools that enable anyone complete a task

Examples
 - Braile display
 - Voice Controls
 - Screen Readers
 - Browser extensions e.t.c

---

Note:

Most assistive technologies for people with motor disabilities either work through
the keyboard or emulate the functionality of the keyboard.

---
# Affordances
Things that give to insight to a user how our pages work e.g buttons, scroll bars,
input, text areas e.t.c. Forexample When you see a date picker you know its time to
enter a date.

```notes
Well designed affordances enable peopl do sth, with little training
They might not be obvious to first timers
```

---
Some one who can't see the screen can't see affordances, hence a need to tell users 
of assistive technologies like screen readers about content.

Can be achieved using `name/labels`, `role` and `value` and `state` to facilitate accessibilty
```notes
Role - Element type
Name - Element Name
Value - Element Value
State - Element State i.e checked, expanded e.t.c
```

([WCAG 4.1.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#name-role-value))

# Accessibility Tree

Built from the DOM tree for assistive technologies.

Its Built from the DOM tree basing on the role, [name/label/alternative text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#text-alternatives), value & state of elements.

Its automatically generated for native elements

```notes
Talk about alt for images and label for form elements & demonstrate purpose of this
using a screen reader
Decorative(Supplementary) images should have empty alt attributes 
```

---
Note:
If we use non native elements in place of native elements e.g. a div in plcae of a button, 
we have to provide a way for assistive technologies to know what that the div is a button
and implement the required keyboard events.

# Navigation

Navigating Content Using Assistive Technologies 

(Screen Readers as case study using [Voice Over](https://webaim.org/articles/voiceover/))

- Headings

```notes
- Sections should have headings
- Dont use heading levels to get smaller headings
```

---
- Form Controls
- [Links](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#link-purpose-link-only)
```notes
- Don't use spans or other elements for Links
- Don't define links with no hrefs
- Don't use links in place of buttons
- Images in links should have alt text
- Use meaningful text in links. Instead of "learn more" use "learn more about js"
```
- Web Spots
- Land Marks ->
    main, header, footer, nav, article, aside, section

---
# Key Take Away
- Use Meaningful headings, Link text and Make a good page structure

---
# ARIA

Enables expressing semantics to screen readers which HTML cant express on its own

Using HTML native elements can help us address issues related to
- DOM Order, Focus, Keyboard, Semantics, Labeling, Headings, Landmarks, Links

---
There are some common UI patterns that are not natively defined in HTML

[WAI-ARIA (Web Accessibility Initiative Accessible Rich Internet Applications)](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/)
has guidelines to solve accessibilty issues not addressed by HTML natively

---
ARIA (WAI ARIA)  

allows you specify attributes on elements whoch modify the way an element
is translated in the accessibilty tree

- It doesnot 
    - Modify element appearance
    - Modify Element behaviour
    - Add focusability
    - Add keyboard event handling

---
What ARIA can do for you
 - Add semantics to HTML elements where no native elements exist
 - Modify existing elements e.g using a button to implement a switch
 - Express more UI patterns that don't exist
 - Express semantic relationship between elements that go beyong parent, child, & sibling
 - Make certain page parts live e.g notifications
---
- ARIA [roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#roles)
- ARIA labels using aria-label, aria-labelledby or aria-described-by
- ARIA relationships e.g aria-labelledby to specify an element(s) that will act
as a label to some element, aria-owns e.t.c
- ARIA live (aria-live) - inform assistive technologies about live content

---
Hiding elements from the accessibilty tree
- aria-hidden
- inert attribute
- hidden attribute e.t.c
